A small client-side tool for encrypting and decrypting messages directly in the browser.  
The site runs entirely in the browser (no server-side crypto) and helps two people exchange encrypted messages using public/private key pairs.

## Features

- Generate a key pair directly in the browser.
- Import and save your peer's public key in localStorage for convenience.
- Encrypt and decrypt messages with AES-GCM derived from ECDH.
- Save your private key encrypted with a password in the browser.
- Mobile-friendly UI with notifications and visual effects.
- Public key fingerprints are shown for verification.

1. Open the site: [Secure Chat](https://pokox3proyoyo-dot.github.io/iugfdssss/)
2. Click **Generate key pair** ‚Üí copy your public key.
3. Send your public key to your peer.
4. Paste your peer's public key in the field ‚Üí click **Import** and verify the fingerprint.
5. To send a message: type it ‚Üí click **Encrypt** ‚Üí copy the ciphertext and send.
6. To decrypt a message: paste the received ciphertext ‚Üí click **Decrypt**.
7. Optionally, you can **save your private key encrypted by a password** in the browser, so you don't need to re-enter it each time.
